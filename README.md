# Data Driven Koopman Control

Main code is in ```exam1.m```

## Provided dynamics
* Duffing oscillator
* Lorenz system
* Inverse Pendulum

## Generate Koopman lifting functions using 3 basis types:-
* Gaussian Kernel
* Monomial Basis
* RBF Thin basis kernel

## Check for RMSE Error between linear lifted dynamics and non-linear dynamics


## LQR and MPC based stabilization for lifted dynamics
The code for MPC control can be found```mpc/run_MPC.mlx```
